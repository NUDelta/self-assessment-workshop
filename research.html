        <h2>Background Research</h2>

        <p>
            This workshop is grounded in our previous research. On this page, we present a brief summary and provide
            references for additional reading.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Previous research [2] has shown that students often self-assess their programming abilities negatively
                in
                moments that are typical in the programming process</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For example, a student may believe they are doing poorly when they need to stop to plan on their
                    assignment, even though their professors would expect them to do that as a part of the programming
                    process.
                </li>
                <li>Women also tend to be more self-critical of their programming abilities in these moments, and
                    students
                    of all genders tend to be more self-critical when comparing themselves to women [3]
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Our recent work [1] has explored students' reasons for their self-assessments (e.g., they think that
                they
                should know enough to not need to plan), as well as *sources* of information for their self-assessment
                criteria (e.g., they see their peers work without planning)
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>We found that students cited their professors as powerful sources for self-assessment criteria, but
                    these sources are not available for all self-assessment moments.
                </li>In lieu of information about what is expected of them as learners, students make assumptions from
                incomplete information about what is expected of them.
                <li><b>This motivates our desire to co-design with faculty interventions that leverage students’ trust
                        in
                        their professor to provide sources of self-assessment criteria to students in a scalable manner.
                    </b></li>
            </ul>
